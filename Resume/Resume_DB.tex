\begin{tabular}{@{}p{1.6cm}p{13.6cm}}
&{\bf How do T-cells distinguish between self and foreign antigens?}\\
MATH 563&Worked in a team of 4 people to evaluate the role of ligand-induced T-cell receptor polymerization and kinetic proof-reading for fast and specific discrimination of antigens. T-cells activate PI3K pathway if the number of bound and fully phosphorylated receptors exceeds a threshold. Used Gillespie simulations to determine the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and to understand how cells adapt their immune response despite high environmental variability.\\[5pt]

&{\bf An Exploratory Study of Properties of Excitable Media}\\
CPSC 530P&Performed numerical simulation and bifurcation analysis of Hodgkin-Huxley and FitzHugh-Nagumo models to study electrophysiological properties (excitability, refractoriness and automaticity) associated with excitable media (e.g. action potential in neurons, pacemaker cells in cardiac tissue, Belousov-Zhabotinsky reaction)\\

&{\bf Design Optimization and Empirical Analysis of a Memetic PSO Algorithm}\\
CPSC 536H&Automatically configured a memetic variant of Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm using ParamILS to solve nonlinear, non-differentiable and multimodal optimization problems. Empirical results for solution quality and run-time were obtained by using benchmark instances based on the 2009 BBOB (Black Box Optimization Benchmark) problem set.\\[5pt]

&{\bf Dynamics of 2{\textendash}patch Predator{\textendash}Prey Rosenzweig{\textendash}MacArthur Model}\\
MATH 562&Derived conditions for existence of limit cycle in predator-prey models with different Holling functional responses. Investigated phase-locking, synchrony and anti-synchrony in two weakly coupled oscillators, where each oscillator represents a limit cycle in the predator-prey system and the weak coupling results from migration between the two systems.
